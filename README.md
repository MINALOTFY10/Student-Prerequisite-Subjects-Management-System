# Database
This project uses a local database to store all the student and subject information. The database is created using SQLite.

# Conclusion
This project provides a simple and efficient way of managing student prerequisite subjects using data structures and a local database. It can be used as a starting point for more complex systems that require similar functionalities. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to contribute to the project.
